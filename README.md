Rabico is a Visual Novel Engine for Android made by HARunaDev.

**Currently Rabico engine is becoming an open-source project, so please wait until I move everything into GitHub.**

[Link to Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cm7dev.Rabico)

### Build from your environment
Download the project as ZIP and open it with Android Studio.

## Rabico! OpenServer
To run the Community OpenServer on your own server, you need a web server with Apache / Nginx, Java 8+, PHP, and some *many* time.

1. Download Full Rabico OpenServer package from [here (Link not ready yet)](harunadev.com)
2. Read the "tou.txt" at "ros/serverinfo/tou.txt", and understand what you (as an operator of Community OpenServer) should / should not do.
3. Unpack the "ros" folder inside ZIP file to the root of the web directory (EX: C:\xampp\htdocs\**ros**)
4. Modify the "info.txt" at "ros/serverinfo/info.txt" as you want (Server name, Region info, Server owner information)
5. Unpack the "server.jar" file at somewhere else than web directory
6. Execute the "server.jar" file using Java with admin privilage (Windows). I recommend using CMDER console emulator for long-term operation.
7. Email your server IP (not domain) with region to harunadev@gmail.com for adding your server as official community server.
